#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

What you need:
  # A multimedia file.
  # A version of FFMPEG for your system. Window users refer to here: http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/wiki/index.php?title=Links.


= Instructions =

  # To start, open a command prompt and navigate using the _cd_ command to the directory with your source media, your ffmpeg executable, and where your output media will be placed.
  # Type the following:
{{{ffmpeg -i INPUT.abc -vframes 20 -s cif -pix_fmt rgb24 OUTPUT.rgb}}}
  # Remember to replace INPUT.abc to your file-to-be-converted, change the -vframes 20 value to however many frames of the media you want converted (or remove for whole media), and optionally changing the OUTPUT.rgb name (leaving the filename extension .rgb intact).
  # There you go! Assuming everything went well, your video file is ready for testing.
