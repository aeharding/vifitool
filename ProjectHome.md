Welcome! This tool is a free, open source tool which assesses both luminance and red flash (in compliance to the WCAG 2.0) of any video file you want. It's currently compiled on Windows, and can be compiled 100% working on Linux and Mac OS X.

For more information of how to use this tool, look into the wiki!

# Abstract #
Online, free, instant, and worldwide distribution of videos is dangerous for those with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE). Even with readily available standards and programs to evaluate and test videos for flickering and flashing that can induce seizures, videos are often not screened or labeled. The Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT) is the only free tool of three tools available (until now) to scan for flickering defects. The license for PEAT allows only web-based noncommercial material to be tested, implicating that individuals with PSE must trust advertisers and other commercial producers to screen and label videos.

I have built an open source program and engine, the Video Flicker Investigation Tool (VIFIT). Built under C and executable under multiple different operating systems, this tool accurately assesses luminance and red flash in content that could potentially cause seizures in people with PSE. Only one of the 71 videos tested through VIFIT conflicted with PEAT where PEAT passed the video and VIFIT failed it (by six frames of luminance flash).

Being open source, VIFIT can be used by the commercial video distributor, the viewer, as well as in statistical scientific video analyses to screen content without any licensing constraints. Also being open source, this program has the potential today to become broadly recognized and more stable, and grow into the platform and underlying open source engine for PSE video accessibility tools of tomorrow -- addressing my overall objective of increasing internet safety and accessibility.
